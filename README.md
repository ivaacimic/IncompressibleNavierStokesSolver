# IncompressibleNavierStokesSolver

This project implements a numerical solution for the 2D lid-driven cavity problem using the vorticity-stream function formulation of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. The code is developed in C++ and optimised for high performance using parallel programming techniques with MPI (Message Passing Interface) and OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing). The repository contains:

- A parallelised solver for the lid-driven cavity problem.
- A Makefile for easy compilation and build.
- HTML documentation generation via Doxygen.
- Performance analysis and optimisation details.

The lid-driven cavity problem models incompressible fluid flow driven by a lateral flow across the top boundary of a square cavity. This is a classic benchmark problem for testing numerical methods in computational fluid dynamics (CFD).
